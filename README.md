# travelagency
This project is a web application developed for a tourism agency, aiming to provide a seamless, user-friendly experience for exploring and booking travel destinations. Built with modern technologies, the platform efficiently integrates frontend, backend, and database systems to deliver a dynamic and secure service.



  Features : 
1. Dynamic Destinations Page: Users can browse through a variety of travel destinations, each with detailed descriptions and images, making it easy to choose their next vacation spot.
2. User Authentication and Registration: Secure user authentication ensures that only registered users can access certain features, such as booking functionalities.
3. Role-Based Access Control: Different levels of access are implemented based on user roles (logged-in or guest), enhancing security and managing user interactions effectively.

   
  Technologies Used
1. Frontend: Developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of dynamic and responsive components, ensuring a smooth user experience.
2. Backend: Built with Java Spring, a powerful framework for building robust and scalable web applications. Spring facilitates the implementation of RESTful APIs, handling backend operations seamlessly.
3. Database: Utilizes MySQL to store and manage data related to destinations, user information, and bookings. MySQL offers reliability and efficiency in handling relational data.
